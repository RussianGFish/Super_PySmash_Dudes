# Super_PySmash_Dudes
A place to hold the code for Python

This project started on January 7th, 2019. It has been continued and worked on ever since. As the name implies, this is a spin-off of
Super Smash Bros. It will have returning game elements, and even new ones only seen here. There are 2 main programmers for the game so far.
We plan to add characters and a full fledged roster in the future.
